This is a Railway announcement program. It gives announcements in both Hindi/English.
I was not able to find an official Indian Railways API for this program so I read the data from an excel file which had train number, train name, platform number, destination etc. already written in it. It genrates a maximum of 27 mp3 files out which files named '1' to '11' are for hindi announcements and files named '12' to '23' are for english announcements and the rest of the four files are a combination of hindi and english audio files generated before.Only four files being generated at the end because the excel contains information for only two trains.
